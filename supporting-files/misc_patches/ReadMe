r08-misc.patch 
	This contains numerous bits that I do not recall.
	
	
r11-bookmarks-v2.patch
	Change the default bookmarks to be Haiku-centric.
	
	
r12-releasenotes.patch
	Remove the "firstrun" tab.  Replace releasenotes with about:buildconfig
	
	
rTTc-bezillaname.patch
	Not Applied.
	This will rename <app>-bin to BeZilla<product>
	However, the makefiles & related files for packaging dist/bin are not updated.
	As a result, `make -C browser/installer` will create an archive that misses the BeZillaBrower binary.
	
	
rZZ-reorder-AppName.diff
	Not Applied.
	This is patch includes the bezillaname.patch
	It also includes the non-functioning re-ordering patch.
	The re-ordering patch is responsible for installing *.so in the correct sub-folder (lib/ or add-ons/)
